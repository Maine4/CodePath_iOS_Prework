# Prework - *Roster*

Submitted by: **Nicole Roberson**

**Roster** is an app that manages a student's academic schedule without the enterprise features typically seen in project management tools.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

Additional improvements:
- [x] Changed the background  to custom color for all three labels
- [x] Added three icons with custom background color
- [x] Included a custom image view
- [x] Navigation Bar with custom background color added
- [x] Font style for all three labels, navigation bar, and button changed to bold
 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Pinterest
1. Customizing topics and boards to follow
2. Short videos

YouTube
1. Saving videos to watch later
2. Notifications about new video uploads from followed channels

Apple Podcast
1. Automatic downloads of favorite podcast
2. Recommendations of similar shows to listen to

I would like to build an assignment tracking tool specifically for students: While there are several project management options available, many of the features are unnecessary for students. Users would be able to organize their academic life (assignments, projects, clubs, networking events, and work) by semester and year. Reminders can be set for deadlines. Students can also have sharing capabilites with link expiration for collaboration and security benefits.
